# MyFirstRepo

### This is my first time creating a Git repository and I am loving every step of the process so far.

I am so grateful for this experience with Per Scholas. Undoubtedly, I will learn a lot of new
skills (programming related & professional), but I am most hopeful that I will gain some new friends and/or future colleagues.

I expect to mold myself into the full stack or backend developer that I dream of becoming and potentially ponder the idea of becoming a Software Engineering instructor.
I cannot express enough how excited I am for this opportunity!
